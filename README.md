# EEG
<p> This is just a couple of files directed to run our EEG data and to extract canonical bands, spectral density of specific channels and plots. Based on MNE-python tools (https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python) and, especially, on the work of Raphael Vallat (https://raphaelvallat.com/index.html#six), who I strongly suggest you to follow!
